Scrum is a framework designed to streamline project management.

The following is how I imagine SCRUM framework might benefit the IT team:

1. **Improved Collaboration**: Scrum promotes cross-functional teamwork and collaboration. By dividing tasks into smaller, manageable units called user stories, team members from different departments can work together effectively. This approach fosters a sense of unity and collective ownership over the project, leading to better problem-solving and innovative solutions.

2. **Adaptability and Flexibility**: Startups often face rapidly changing requirements and priorities. Scrum's iterative approach allows the team to adapt quickly to changes. Through regular meetings like daily stand-ups and sprint reviews, the team can assess progress, identify roadblocks, and make necessary adjustments, ensuring that the project stays aligned with the school's evolving needs.

3. **Transparency and Accountability**: Scrum promotes transparency by making project progress visible to all stakeholders. With tools like sprint backlogs and burndown charts, everyone has access to real-time updates on the project's status. This transparency fosters accountability, as team members take ownership of their tasks and commitments. Additionally, regular sprint reviews provide opportunities for stakeholders to provide feedback, ensuring that the final product meets their expectations.

4. **Faster Delivery of Value**: Scrum emphasizes delivering value to the customer in short, frequent intervals known as sprints. By breaking down the project into smaller increments, the IT team can deliver usable features or enhancements more quickly. This incremental delivery approach allows the school to start realizing the benefits of the IT infrastructure sooner, providing them with a competitive edge in the market.

5. **Continuous Improvement**: Scrum encourages a culture of continuous improvement. At the end of each sprint, the team conducts a retrospective to reflect on what went well and what could be improved. This introspective process allows the team to identify bottlenecks, refine their processes, and implement changes that optimize their workflow over time, leading to increased efficiency and productivity.

Overall, by embracing Scrum principles and practices, the school's IT team can streamline their operations, enhance collaboration, respond quickly to changes, and deliver value to the school more efficiently, ultimately contributing to the success of the startup.

7. As a library member, I want to view my borrowing history, so that I can keep track of the books I've borrowed in the past.
